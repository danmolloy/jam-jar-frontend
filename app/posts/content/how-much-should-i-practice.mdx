title: 'How Much Should I Practice?'
excerpt: 'Music culture loves myths of punishing devotion, but real progress comes from focused, mentally engaged work in short blocks with breaks. After a point, attention drops and mistakes harden.'

**In short:**

Ideally, one should practise every day. Small, consistent amounts of mentally engaged practice are far more effective than sporadic marathon sessions.
Daily practice guidelines:

- Beginner: 20–60 minutes per day
- Intermediate: 1–2.5 hours
- Conservatoire / professional: 2–4 hours

Practice should focus on quality and consistency, rather than long, concentrated blocks. Yet music culture has always been full of legends about artists reaching great heights through punishing devotion.

In Hindustani classical music, chilla is a rite of passage in which a student isolates themselves from the outside world for forty days. During this period, they follow a strict diet and attempt to avoid sleep. Some stories even describe musicians tying their long hair to the ceiling so that if their head began to nod, the pain would jolt them awake.

Western music has its own versions of these myths. In rock guitar circles, Steve Vai’s legendary “10-hour workout” is often reprinted in magazines, and generations of aspiring guitarists have used it as a test of discipline.

These stories are seductive because they support a comforting belief: if you just work harder than everyone else, you will succeed. Hard work is certainly a necessary ingredient, but in music the most important factor is not how long you practise, but how you practice.

The reality is that some instruments are physically unforgiving, and practice time is limited by anatomy as much as ambition. After three hours, the strain on a French horn player’s embouchure may surpass anything a pianist’s hands experience.

On top of this, less experienced musicians often carry unnecessary physical tension in posture and technique, which further limits how long they can practise without fatigue or injury. Many players don’t stop because their mind is tired — they stop because their body begins to break down.

Ultimately, the most important aspect of practice is not duration, but mental engagement. With regular breaks, very few professional musicians would advocate practising beyond three to four hours per day. Beyond that, attention declines, mistakes become habitual, and the returns diminish sharply.

After around ninety minutes, focus tends to drop and you start reinforcing errors. The danger isn’t simply “wasting time” — it’s practising the wrong thing into your muscle memory. You don’t only learn when you play correctly; you also learn when you repeat mistakes.

This is why professionals rarely practise four hours straight. They practise in 45–60 minute blocks, separated by short breaks. This keeps the brain sharp and reduces the risk of injury, while making the work more sustainable over weeks and months. It is easier to do three hours of excellent practice than four hours of dull, exhausted repetition.

Another important point is that “practice” does not always mean time spent physically playing. Rather than spending an entire day repeating licks or excerpts, an hour working with a great teacher can save you weeks of blind trial and error. Recording yourself and listening back critically can also be more transformative than another hour of repetition. Comparing your playing with great recordings of the same music broadens your understanding and forces you to hear what you are actually producing, rather than what you imagine you are producing.

In fact, some of the most valuable practice can happen away from the instrument. Charles Mingus spent a period of his life working in the sorting office of the US Postal Service, and claimed he would mentally practise walking over changes during his shifts. Similarly, Mozart is said to have composed much of his music while walking in nature. The instrument may be the tool, but the real work happens in the mind.

If anything, a better question than “how much should I practise?” is: what should my practice contain? A balanced practice routine usually includes some combination of technical work, slow practice, targeted problem-solving, repertoire maintenance, and musical exploration. Even twenty minutes can be highly effective if the goal is specific and the attention is focused.

The most important thing, long-term, is to find a way to enjoy practice. Unless you are employed by a busy orchestra or band, practice is what will likely make up the majority of your time as a musician. If you build a daily routine that is satisfying and sustainable, progress becomes inevitable.

Legends of musicians tying their hair to the ceiling make for dramatic stories. But in real life, the best discipline is not forcing yourself to practise endlessly — it is finding enjoyment in practising consistently, and knowing when to stop.
